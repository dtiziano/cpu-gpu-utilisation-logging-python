# cpu-gpu-utilisation-logging-python

Log CPU and GPU utilisation at regular intervals, with Python.

Why? So you can save the utilisation to disk and look at it later.

## Utilisation
Run the script from the run.ipynb notebook. Once finished, stop the process from within the notebook (second cell). 
Use the plotting funcitonalities to inspet the data

## Demo

A Kaggle kernel showing the CPU and GPU logger in action is available here:

## Dependencies

- Python
- nvidia-smi

An alternative [bash/shell implementation is also available](https://github.com/scottclowe/cpu-gpu-utilisation-logging).
